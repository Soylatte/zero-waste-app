            <p>A portion of the proceeds will be donated to beautiful people and organizations that are changing the world in your name,
                 as well as those who need a warm hand.

                The goal of our project is to make every day of our lives a social project itself.</p>
                <p>We are in business to make sure that our all-home planet doesn't die.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>We strive to leave nothing in the world for the next generation.
                Because there isn't much we can leave in the world.</p>
                <br />
                <p>At the same time, we record the values that we can leave to the next generation.
                 Our writings are about love and nature, wisdom and art, and good technology.</p>
